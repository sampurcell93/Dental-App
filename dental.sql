It is important to note that try-\r\nin screws are not designed to be torqued. Often the dental\r\nlaboratory is asked to fabricate a positioning jig, to help\r\nfind the correct orientation of the abutment. Seating of the\r\ncustom abutments can cause discomfort to the patient, as\r\nthe emergence profile of the abutment may be significantly\r\nbigger than the healing abutment. In these cases, use of\r\nlocal anesthesia may be indicated. Once the abutment is\r\nseated, a periapical or bitewing radiograph may need to\r\nbe obtained to verify seating (fig 19 will be inserted here).\r\nThe crown is then tried in checking the proximal contacts\r\nfirst. Verification of marginal fit is followed by checking the\r\nocclusal contacts.\r\n\r\nScrew-retained single implant crowns are tried in a similar\r\nway. Since the crown is made directly on the abutment,\r\nit is carried into the mouth, abutment screw is tightened\r\nslowly and proximal contacts are checked first. (fig 20 will be\r\ninserted here) If the clinician believes that proximal contacts\r\nare acceptable, then a periapical or bitewing radiograph is\r\nobtained. Occlusion is checked last.\r\n\r\n(see insertion: next)\r\n\r\n<h3>Insertion</h3>\r\n<h4>Required materials and suggested implant components</h4>\r\n<li>Manual implant screwdriver (short, medium or long\r\ndepending on the clinical situation) (figure 15 will be\r\ninserted here)</li>\r\n<li>Manual torque wrench</li>\r\n<li>Machine heads for torque wrench</li>\r\n<li>Articulating paper</li>\r\n<li>Disclosing medium (i.e. fit checker) (figure 16 will\r\nbe inserted here)</li>\r\n<li>Gutta-percha</li>\r\n<li>Composite resin</li>\r\n<li>Cotton-pelets</li>\r\n<li>Burs, polishing disks (figure 17 will be inserted here)</li>\r\n<li>Slow-, and high-speed handpieces</li>\r\n<li>Restorative/prosthodontics instrument cassette</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Information</h4>\r\nIf the implant crown is tried in and found to be acceptable, then\r\nthe abutment is placed using the appropriate final abutment\r\nscrew.

For majority of the cases, an implant-levelimpression is required. This enables the dentist/ technicianto choose the most appropriate abutment. The traditionalimplant impressions are made using machined impressioncopings that are specific for the implant placed andmedium-, or medium-light body elastomeric impressionmaterials.Open-tray technique is also known as the Ã¢Â€Âœpick-uptechniqueÃ¢Â€Â. The impression coping is picked up with theimpression.Closed-tray technique is known as the Ã¢Â€ÂœtransfertechniqueÃ¢Â€Â. After removal of the impression tray, theimpression coping stays on the implant. It is then removed,and the implant replica is connected and the impressioncoping-implant replica is transferred to the impression.</li><li>Digital impressions at the implant level can be made usingcoded abutments or impression posts specific to someimplant companies (figure Chairside data acquisition isperformed with a CADCAM system (i.e. Cerec, Lava,E4D Dentist) that enables the dentist to send the digitalimpression to a production facility for fabrication of a model</li><li>Identify the type and platform of the implant to be restored.

Usuallya separate try-in appointment is not required. In situationswhere esthetics is priority, a single implant crown may needto be tried-in and sent back to the dental laboratory forimprovements.<h4>Required materials and suggested implant components</h4><ul><li>Manual implant screwdriver (short, medium or longdepending on the clinical situation) (figure 15 will beinserted here)</li><li>Articulating paper</li><li>Disclosing medium (i.e. fit checker) (figure 16 willbe inserted here)</li><li>Burs, polishing disks (figure 17 will be inserted here)</li><li>Slow-, and high-speed handpieces</li><li>Restorative/prosthodontics instrument cassette</li></ul><h4>Clinical Procedure</h4>Healing abutment or provisional implant crown is removed.For cement-retained restorations, the abutment is placedonto the implant first, using a try-in screw ((figure 18 willbe inserted here) is used. It is important to note that try-in screws are not designed to be torqued. Often the dentallaboratory is asked to fabricate a positioning jig, to helpfind the correct orientation of the abutment. Seating of thecustom abutments can cause discomfort to the patient, asthe emergence profile of the abutment may be significantlybigger than the healing abutment. In these cases, use oflocal anesthesia may be indicated. Once the abutment isseated, a periapical or bitewing radiograph may need tobe obtained to verify seating (fig 19 will be inserted here).The crown is then tried in checking the proximal contactsfirst. Verification of marginal fit is followed by checking theocclusal contacts.Screw-retained single implant crowns are tried in a similarway. Since the crown is made directly on the abutment,it is carried into the mouth, abutment screw is tightenedslowly and proximal contacts are checked first. (fig 20 will beinserted here) If the clinician believes that proximal contactsare acceptable, then a periapical or bitewing radiograph isobtained. Occlusion is checked last.(see insertion: next)<h3>Insertion</h3><h4>Required materials and suggested implant components</h4><li>Manual implant screwdriver (short, medium or longdepending on the clinical situation) (figure 15 will beinserted here)</li><li>Manual torque wrench</li><li>Machine heads for torque wrench</li><li>Articulating paper</li><li>Disclosing medium (i.e. fit checker) (figure 16 willbe inserted here)</li><li>Gutta-percha</li><li>Composite resin</li><li>Cotton-pelets</li><li>Burs, polishing disks (figure 17 will be inserted here)</li><li>Slow-, and high-speed handpieces</li><li>Restorative/prosthodontics instrument cassette</li><h4>Information</h4>If the implant crown is tried in and found to be acceptable, thenthe abutment is placed using the appropriate final abutmentscrew.
